<p>I wanted to make a portfolio that would stand out against the hundreds of others,
    so I decided to make mine a space exploration experience. Since my career goals 
    revolve around gameplay programming and front-end web development, this seemed like
    a natural blending of the two.
</p>
<br>
<p>I started this project by making a basic scene in threejs and adding a spaceship with basic
    movement, using setting a velocity value and applying that to the position every tick. I soon
    found the limitations of that and changed to a force based movement system which allows for 
    constant acceleration when a key is pressed. I also realised that, although there's no drag in 
    space, it was difficult to fly accurately without any drag so I created a drag value that's 
    proportional to the current velocity and is applied to the velocity every frame.
</p>
<br>
<p>When creating controls, I started by using lots of if statements in the tick function in coordination 
    with key down and key up DOM events. But this wasn't very readable so I created a key and a mouse class 
    each with relevant custom events that handle all the necessary inputs and can be bound to functions in 
    a much more readable fashion.
</p>
<br>
<p>For the UI, I used Vue components, creating and removing them at runtime. I used Vue's props to pass 
    values like the title and description into the component. I created a planet class that creates UI panels 
    when a raycast hits it and when it is selected. It's constructor takes props that get sent to the UI 
    components props to populate universal values, however, I wanted to be able to send more specific and 
    unique data to the panels so I could make things like this. So I made a custom slot that can take a html 
    file, it gets set in the planets props and sent to the UI component.
